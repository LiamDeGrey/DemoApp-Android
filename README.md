# Demo App

Quick project built up in a few spare hours.
Created purely to show off the style of my development practise, minimal time has been spent designing and creating the UI.
Built using Kotlin and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) structure.

The app shows the next 50 rockets to be launched across the globe from the API https://spacelaunchnow.me
